# Chapter 5: Practical Examples and Case Studies - Specification

## Overview
This document specifies the content, structure, and requirements for Chapter 5 of the Teaching AI Native Book, titled "Practical Examples and Case Studies". This chapter focuses on demonstrating the concepts covered in previous chapters through real-world examples and detailed case studies. The chapter will provide readers with concrete illustrations of how spec-driven workflows and human-in-the-loop collaboration work in practice.

## Chapter Purpose
To provide readers with practical, real-world examples and detailed case studies that demonstrate how to implement spec-driven workflows and human-in-the-loop collaboration in AI-native development. The chapter will bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and practical implementation through concrete examples that readers can relate to and learn from.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this chapter, readers will be able to:
- Understand how spec-driven workflows operate in real-world scenarios
- Apply human-in-the-loop collaboration principles to practical situations
- Analyze case studies to identify best practices and common pitfalls
- Adapt examples to their own development contexts
- Evaluate the effectiveness of different AI-native development approaches
- Recognize patterns in successful AI-native development implementations
- Draw lessons from both successful and unsuccessful implementations
