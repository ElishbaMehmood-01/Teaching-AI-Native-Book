# Chapter 1: Introduction to AI-Native Development - Specification

## Overview
This document specifies the content, structure, and requirements for Chapter 1 of the Teaching AI Native Book, titled "Introduction to AI-Native Development". This chapter serves as the foundational chapter that introduces readers to the concept of AI-native development and how it differs from traditional software development approaches.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this chapter, readers will be able to:
- Define AI-native development and distinguish it from traditional software development
- Understand the fundamental shifts in workflow, tools, and mindset required for AI-native development
- Identify the key characteristics that make a development process "AI-native"
- Recognize the benefits and challenges of AI-native development approaches
- Apply basic principles of AI-native development to a simple example

## Target Audience
- University-level computer science and software engineering students
- Educators teaching modern software development practices
- Developers transitioning to AI-native workflows

## Content Structure

### 1.1 What is AI-Native Development?

- Reproducible development processes

### 1.5 Practical Example: A Simple AI-Native Workflow
- Walkthrough of a basic development task using AI-native principles
- Comparison with traditional approach
- Key takeaways and best practices

### 1.6 Challenges and Considerations
- Quality assurance in AI-assisted code
- Maintaining human oversight and understanding
- Ethical considerations
- Security and intellectual property concerns

### 1.7 Summary and Next Steps
- Recap of key concepts
- Connection to subsequent chapters
- Exercises and further reading
