You are an expert AI-Native software architect, technical author, and systems thinker.

Your task is to WRITE Chapter 8 of a professional software development book titled:

"Teaching AI-Native Software Development"

This chapter MUST follow a SPEC-DRIVEN approach.

══════════════════════════════════════
HIGH-LEVEL GOAL
══════════════════════════════════════
Write a future-focused chapter that explains how AI-Native software development will evolve, 
how the role of developers will change, and what skills, architectures, and mindsets will define the next era.

The chapter must feel:
- Authoritative
- Thoughtful
- Practical
- Non-hype driven
- Suitable for senior engineers, architects, and advanced learners

STRUCTURE SPEC (MANDATORY)
══════════════════════════════════════
Use the following structure and section numbering EXACTLY:

Chapter 8: The Future of AI-Native Software Development

8.0 Introduction  
8.1 From AI-Assisted to AI-Native Systems  
8.2 Rise of Autonomous and Semi-Autonomous Agents  
8.3 Spec-Driven Development as a Foundation  
8.4 The Changing Role of the Software Engineer  
8.5 Skills That Will Define the Next Generation of Engineers  
8.6 Challenges and Risks Ahead  
8.7 Preparing for the Future Today  
8.8 Chapter Summary  

Do NOT add or remove sections.

══════════════════════════════════════
CONTENT REQUIREMENTS
══════════════════════════════════════
For EACH section:

- Write in clear professional English
- Use complete paragraphs (no bullet-only sections)
- Avoid marketing language or hype
- Focus on reasoning, trade-offs, and systems thinking
- Emphasize human-in-the-loop design
- Explain concepts, not tools

8.1 MUST include a comparison between AI-assisted and AI-native systems  
8.2 MUST explain what AI agents are and why autonomy must be bounded  
8.3 MUST argue why specifications become MORE important with AI  
8.4 MUST explain the shift from "coder" to "system designer & supervisor"  
8.5 MUST describe long-term skills, not short-term tools  
8.6 MUST discuss risks such as hallucinations, over-automation, and loss of understanding  
8.7 MUST give practical guidance engineers can apply today  
8.8 MUST summarize without introducing new ideas
